# Express js personal: my implementation
I used the instructions and tried i did have any idea which way to do it. I could embed new html to refresh the client, use json to make a REST api, or return a template with the new data sent to the server. I decided to stick as much as possible the standard so my api is accesible in a standard and comfy way for other things other than a browser tied to html

I made some simple styles for each html and some are not used in both but they were little so i merged them in one file

- In-memory data storage, i wont use json or a db for this simple app
- all api endpoints start with /api/ to differentiate from html routes
- i just have three static files, i think theres no need to create another dir ('static','html', etc.)
